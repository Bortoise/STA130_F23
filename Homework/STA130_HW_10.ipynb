However, as you might have noticed, `Feature Importance` does not tell you much about the relationship between a feature and the classification model's predictions, beyond that a given feature might be important to the prediction process. In linear regression, you can read off the regression coefficients to determine the numerical relationship between a predictor and the output. For more complicated general models, it is hard to reduce the relationship between prodictors and prediction to a single number, thus we will be using `Partial dependence plots` (PDPs) to try and understand these relationships better."
